# Welcome to your Jupyter Book

This is a small sample book to give you a feel for how book content is
structured.
It shows off a few of the major file types, as well as some sample content.
It does not go in-depth into any particular topic - check out [the Jupyter Book documentation](https://jupyterbook.org) for more information.

Check out the content pages bundled with this sample book to see more.

## This is a title

Some text with inline math: $E = mc^2$

```{note}
This is a note with special formatting.
```

```{code}
print("Hello, World!")
```

In this example:
- $E = mc^2$ is inline LaTeX math.
- The `{note}` directive renders a special note.
- The `{code-cell}` directive embeds code that can be executed.

MyST is great for creating more interactive and well-structured content 

:::{note}
Here is a note!

And here is a code block:

```
